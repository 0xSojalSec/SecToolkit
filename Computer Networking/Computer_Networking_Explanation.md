# **Computer Networking: From Basics to Advanced**

## **1. Introduction to Computer Networking**

### **1.1 What is Computer Networking?**
A computer network is a group of interconnected devices that communicate with each other to share resources and data. These networks can be as small as two computers in a home or as large as millions of devices spread across the globe.

### **1.2 Types of Networks**
- **LAN (Local Area Network):** A network that covers a small geographic area, like a home, school, or office building.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** A network that covers a large geographic area, often a country or continent, using leased telecommunication lines.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** A network that spans a city or a large campus.
- **PAN (Personal Area Network):** A network that covers a very small area, typically around a single person, using devices like smartphones and tablets.

### **1.3 Network Topologies**
- **Bus Topology:** All devices are connected to a single central cable, known as the bus.
- **Star Topology:** All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
- **Ring Topology:** Each device is connected to two other devices, forming a circular data path.
- **Mesh Topology:** Every device is connected to every other device in the network.
- **Hybrid Topology:** A combination of two or more different types of topologies.

### **2.3 Comparison between OSI and TCP/IP Models**
- OSI is a theoretical model, while TCP/IP is a practical implementation.
- OSI has 7 layers; TCP/IP has 4 layers.
- OSI model is more general, while TCP/IP is specific to the internet.
