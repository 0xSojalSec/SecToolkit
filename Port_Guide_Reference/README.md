# Port Guide Reference

## üìñ Overview

In networking, **ports** are critical for defining specific entry points in systems, allowing data to flow between devices and applications. Each port number is unique to a particular service or application, ensuring data reaches its intended target. Every internet-connected device has **65,536 ports** (divided between TCP and UDP), each serving a specific purpose. 

This repository serves as a detailed guide to ports, ranges, and common assignments to help network administrators, developers, and security professionals in understanding port roles and functions.

## üåê What is a Port?

A **port** is an endpoint in network communication where data packets are directed to reach a service or application on a device. Ports enable multiple services to run on a single device by distinguishing traffic intended for different applications. Ports are divided into TCP and UDP categories, each with specific roles for communication.

---

## üîç Port Ranges

Ports are divided into three main categories:

- **Well-Known Ports (0-1023):** Commonly used ports reserved for standard services (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
- **Registered Ports (1024-49151):** Used by user applications and sometimes dynamically assigned.
- **Dynamic/Private Ports (49152-65535):** Commonly used for temporary connections in client-server models.
