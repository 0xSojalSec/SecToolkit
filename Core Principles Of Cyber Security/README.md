# Seven Key Rules in Cybersecurity

## 1. Confidentiality

**Topic**: Data Protection  
**Brief**: Ensure that sensitive information is accessible only to those authorized to view it. This involves encryption, access controls, and policies to protect data from unauthorized access.

## 2. Integrity

**Topic**: Data Integrity  
**Brief**: Maintain the accuracy and completeness of data over its lifecycle. Implement checksums, hashing, and access controls to prevent unauthorized modifications, ensuring that data remains unaltered and reliable.

## 3. Availability

**Topic**: System Reliability  
**Brief**: Ensure that systems and data are available to authorized users when needed. This includes implementing redundancy, regular backups, and robust disaster recovery plans to minimize downtime and service interruptions.

## 4. Authentication

**Topic**: User Verification  
**Brief**: Verify the identity of users accessing systems and data. Strong authentication mechanisms, such as passwords, biometrics, and multi-factor authentication (MFA), help ensure that only legitimate users gain access.

## 5. Authorization

**Topic**: Access Control  
**Brief**: Define and enforce what authenticated users are allowed to do within the system. Role-based access control (RBAC) and the principle of least privilege help limit access to sensitive resources.

## 6. Non-Repudiation

**Topic**: Accountability  
**Brief**: Ensure that actions taken by users or systems cannot be denied after the fact. Digital signatures, audit logs, and encryption help create a trail of evidence, ensuring that actions are attributable to the correct entities.

## 7. Auditability

**Topic**: Monitoring and Logging  
**Brief**: Maintain detailed records of system activities to detect and investigate security incidents. Continuous monitoring, logging, and regular audits help identify potential threats and ensure compliance with security policies.
